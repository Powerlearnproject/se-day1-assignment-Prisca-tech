   - The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the **NATO Software Engineering Conference** to address the "software crisis" caused by increasing software complexity and frequent project failures. This led to the development of structured programming and formalized development processes.  

2. **The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s–1990s)**  
   - The introduction of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, with languages like C++ and Java, revolutionized software development. OOP improved code reuse, modularity, and maintainability, making software more scalable and efficient.  

3. **The Agile Movement (2001-Present)**  
   - The **Agile Manifesto**, published in 2001, introduced a flexible, iterative approach to software development. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban prioritize collaboration, adaptability, and delivering functional software quickly, replacing rigid, documentation-heavy models like Waterfall.  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
### **Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**  

1. **Planning** – Define project goals, feasibility, scope, and resource requirements.  

2. **Requirements Analysis** – Gather and document user needs, system functionalities, and constraints.  

3. **Design** – Create system architecture, user interfaces, and data models based on requirements.  

4. **Implementation (Coding)** – Develop the software by writing and integrating code.  

5. **Testing** – Identify and fix bugs through various testing methods to ensure software quality.  

6. **Deployment** – Release the software to users or production environments.  

7. **Maintenance** – Provide updates, bug fixes, and improvements after deployment.  


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

### **Waterfall vs. Agile Methodology**  

| Aspect         | Waterfall | Agile |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| **Approach** | Linear and sequential | Iterative and flexible |
| **Phases** | Each phase (planning, design, development, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next | Work is divided into small, iterative cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid, difficult to change requirements once development starts | Highly adaptable, allows changes throughout development |
| **User Involvement** | Minimal user involvement until the final product is delivered | Continuous user feedback and collaboration |
| **Delivery Time** | Delivered at the end of the project | Delivered in increments, with working software after each sprint |
| **Best For** | Projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes | Projects with evolving requirements and a need for rapid delivery |
